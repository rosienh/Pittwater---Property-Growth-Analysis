# Pittwater---Property-Growth-Analysis

## 1. Background and Overview
This analysis investigates the long-term investment potential of Pittwater’s property market, focusing on capital gain rather than rental yield or dwelling size. It is designed to support everyday investors who typically hold properties for five years or more.

To assess Pittwater’s viability, the study draws on:

Historical median housing prices from 1991 to 2017

CPI-adjusted values to account for inflation

Comparative data from nearby LGAs including Manly, Warringah, and Greater Sydney

2021 sales data for retrospective validation

The goal is to determine whether Pittwater offers reliable, stable returns and how it compares to surrounding regions.
